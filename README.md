This is a learning example of thread start, pause, and end to help friends learn and master:

Thread is a fundamental unit in computer program execution, responsible for executing a series of instructions within the program.
 The following are Chinese explanations for thread start, pause, and end:
Thread starts
Definition: Thread initiation refers to the process in which a thread is created and prepared to perform its task.
explain:
When a thread is created, it is in a "ready" state, meaning it is ready to execute but has not yet been scheduled by the CPU.
Thread initiation typically involves allocating necessary resources, such as stack space, and setting the initial execution point of the thread.
In a multi-threaded environment, the start of a thread can be explicitly controlled by the program, for example, in Java, the Thread. start() method can be used to start a thread.
Thread pause
Definition: Thread pause refers to the temporary suspension of a thread during execution, waiting for a certain condition to be met before resuming execution.
explain:
Thread pause can be caused by various reasons, such as waiting for a resource, receiving a pause instruction, or reaching a synchronization point.
The pause state can be active, such as when a thread calls methods like wait(), sleep(), etc;
 It can also be passive, such as being called by other threads using the suspend() method (note: the suspend() method is deprecated in Java as it may cause deadlocks).
The paused thread can resume execution after the conditions are met, enter the "ready" state, and wait for CPU scheduling.
Thread ends
Definition: Thread termination refers to the process in which a thread exits execution after completing its task.
explain:
The end of a thread can be normal, meaning that the thread naturally ends after completing its task;
 It can also be abnormal, such as a thread terminating due to an error or exception.
Before the thread ends, some cleaning work is usually done, such as releasing resources, closing file handles, etc.
After the thread ends, its status changes to 'terminated' and it no longer participates in CPU scheduling.
In multi-threaded programs, the main thread (or other supervisory thread) may wait for the child threads to finish to ensure that all tasks are completed before continuing or exiting the program.
precautions
The lifecycle management of threads requires careful handling to avoid issues such as resource leaks and deadlocks.
Different programming languages and operating systems may have different implementations and APIs for thread management, but the basic concepts are the same.
In multi-threaded programming, proper synchronization and communication are key to ensuring program correctness.
By properly managing the start, pause, and end of threads, the capabilities of multi-core processors can be effectively utilized to improve program concurrency and responsiveness.
